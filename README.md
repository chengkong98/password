# password project
Make a password program to project a simulated log in access.

# Goal
The goal is to be able to create and generate an identity with a first and last name, an e-mail, and then creating a username and password. Ensure that all the inputs will associate with eachother and when asked to log in, the username and the password should already be in the database along with minor peronal information (name, email).
